#Overview of Project 
We are helping Steve get more information on the stock market performance for the last few years. This information will help his parents make good stocks investments going forward. 
#Result 
All Stocks 2017 was an overall good year for stocks besides TERP that down 7.2%. All other stocks this year performance above 5% with 199.4% being the highest return. 

All Stocks 2018 was not a good year for stocks. Stocks return drop at least 3.5% with high drop at 62.6%. ENPH and RUN were the only stocks that performance well with return at 81.9% and 84% respectively. 

#Summary 
2017 was a good year for stocks, especially for DQ, the stocks that Steve parents had eyes on performing at a 199.4% return rate. However, keep track of this stock as well as the market, stocks performance drop across the board in 2018 with only ENPH and RUN that gave positive returns. Recommendations are to track stocks across the board in 2019 to prevent any bad investments.
